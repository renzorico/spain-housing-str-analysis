# The Catalan tourist-stay limit: a tourist flat (HUT) is let for an "estada
# de temporada", "a continuous period of 31 days or fewer" (Decret 75/2020,
# art. 221-1, as quoted in STC 64/2025, BOE-A-2025-7430). An HUT must be let
# whole (Llei 13/2002, art. 50 bis), so private rooms cannot hold one.
# Whether a 31-NIGHT booking counts as "31 days or fewer" is ambiguous, so
# listings are only ever labelled by what they ask: under 31, exactly 31 or
# over 31 nights minimum. A minimum stay is a setting, not a contract, an
# actual stay or a legal finding. Outside Catalonia this number has no legal
